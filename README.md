# BankReader
This is a basic application written for windows in WPF. It accepts a start and an exported file from your bank. 
After the basic selection it will parse the file and add a predefined category to each line. The categories are determined by the
name or account number in the exported line.

Currently this application only supports 2 banks from Belgium (Belfius & Argenta).


Download, compile and enjoy!
